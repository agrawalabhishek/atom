@todo Implement diagnostics in Atom solver.
@todo Find a way to provide an option to clean installation.
@todo Extend test suite.
@todo Figure out better way (avoiding code duplication) to build STL-based and Eigen-based tests in the same build tree.
@todo Find a way to remove \cond \endcond workaround to get Doxygen to not throw warnings in readme.
@todo Find a way to have nested variables in `Doxygen` config file so that e.g., `@@CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_VERSION@` works.
@todo Add version detection in `CMake` module so that find_package respects minimum version required.
